 * build.js — one string identifying the code this container is running.
 *
 * Portainer polls and deploys on its own; nothing reports back. Without an
 * endpoint that moves when the code moves, a deploy that never landed and one
 * that landed without helping look identical from outside — octopus-science
 * lost three rounds of bug reports to exactly that.
 *
 * ── Derived, not a pasted constant ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * octopus-ee and octopus-science keep `const BUILD = '…'` because their browser
 * code carries the same literal and the comparison needs one. This service does
 * not, and needs the opposite property: a stamp you must remember to bump
 * reports "nothing changed" for a deploy that did, the first time anyone
 * forgets. That is a check failing quietly toward "everything is fine". So it
 * is computed at startup and cannot drift.
 *
 * ── What it covers ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything that ships except dependencies and live data — including views/ and public/, because a fixed template or stylesheet is exactly the kind of change you want to confirm landed.
 *
 * The files are found by WALKING the directory, not from a list here. A written
 * list stops covering the file just added, and that failure is silent in the
 * worst way: the guard goes quiet exactly for the newest code.

/**
 * ─── Cache-busting for the client assets ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Cloudflare caches CSS and JS for four hours and OVERRIDES the origin's
 * Cache-Control, so a shipped front-end fix is invisible for that long and looks
 * exactly like a deploy that failed. On 2026-09-05 a menu fix on the public site
 * was correct, deployed, verified in a browser — and still broken for the person
 * looking at it, because they were being served August's stylesheet
 * (`cf-cache-status: HIT`, `age: 1332`). octopus-science lost three rounds of bug
 * reports to the same thing.
 *
 * `/theme.css?v=ab12cd34` is a different URL, so it is fetched fresh the moment
 * it is deployed. No purge, no API token, nothing to remember.
 *
 * ── Per file, not per build ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The stamp is a hash of THAT FILE's content, not BUILD. BUILD moves whenever
 * any server file changes, which would re-download every asset on every deploy
 * and throw away caching that is doing its job. A per-file hash changes when and
 * only when that asset does.
 *
 * ── Read once at startup ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The files are immutable for the life of the container — the image is rebuilt
 * to change them — so hashing on each render would be pure cost. An asset that
 * cannot be read returns the bare path rather than throwing: a missing stamp is
 * a stale cache, a thrown error is a blank page.
